    <p className="pb-6">Eat a Healthy Diet: Focus on eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins such as fish, poultry, beans, and nuts. Limit saturated fats found in red meat and full-fat dairy products, as well as trans fats found in fried and processed foods. Choose healthier fats, such as those found in olive oil and avocados, and limit your intake of salt and added sugars.
Maintain a Healthy Weight: Calculate your body mass index (BMI) to determine if you're in a healthy weight range. If you're overweight or obese, aim to lose weight gradually by making healthy food choices and increasing your physical activity.</p>

    <p className="pb-6">Exercise Regularly: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking or cycling, each week. Additionally, incorporate muscle-strengthening exercises, such as lifting weights or yoga, into your routine on two or more days per week.
    Quit Smoking: If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your heart health. Smoking damages your blood vessels, raises your blood pressure, and increases your risk of blood clots. Seek support from healthcare professionals or smoking cessation programs to help you quit.</p>

    <p className="pb-6">Limit Alcohol: If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. This means up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. Excessive alcohol consumption can raise your blood pressure and increase your risk of heart disease.

Manage Stress: Chronic stress can contribute to heart disease. Practice stress-reducing techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature. Engaging in hobbies and activities you enjoy can also help reduce stress.</p>

    <p className="pb-6">Control High Blood Pressure: High blood pressure (hypertension) is a major risk factor for heart disease. Monitor your blood pressure regularly and follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for keeping it under control. This may include lifestyle changes and medication.

Control Cholesterol Levels: High cholesterol levels can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease. Eat a diet low in saturated and trans fats, exercise regularly, and take cholesterol-lowering medications if prescribed by your healthcare provider.</p>

    <p className="pb-6">Manage Diabetes: If you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood sugar levels under control. Monitor your blood sugar regularly, follow a healthy eating plan, exercise regularly, and take medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider.

Get Regular Check-ups: Visit your healthcare provider regularly for check-ups and screenings. They can help you monitor your heart health and identify any risk factors or early signs of heart disease.</p>

    <p className="pb-6">Take Medications as Prescribed: If your healthcare provider has prescribed medications to manage your heart disease or its risk factors, take them exactly as directed. This may include medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots.</p>
